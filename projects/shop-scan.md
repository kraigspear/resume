## Overview

This is one of those magic moments where the right people were brought together at the right time to make something truly remarkable.

shop & scan enabled Meijer to leverage their 250+ store locations combined with mobile technology capabilities to compete with online retailers. By allowing customers to scan items as they shop and checkout seamlessly through their mobile devices, we transformed the in-store shopping experience.

## My Role

**Senior Software Engineer** - I completed the majority of the work on this project through October 2019, serving as the sole iOS developer responsible for the entire iOS implementation.

## The Problem

Traditional brick-and-mortar retailers faced increasing pressure from online competitors who offered convenience and speed. Meijer needed a solution that would leverage their physical store network while providing the digital convenience customers expected. The challenge was to create a seamless mobile shopping experience that would make checkout as fast as shopping itself.

## The Solution

We developed shop & scan, a mobile application that allows customers to:
- Scan items as they shop throughout the store
- See real-time pricing and product information
- Clip coupons they might have missed
- Checkout instantly without waiting in line

## Technical Highlights

### First Internal Component Framework
Created the first internally-developed component framework within the Meijer Mobile App that operated with **95% independence** from the core codebase. This architecture minimized risk to the main application while enabling rapid feature development and iteration.

### Pioneer Shopping Capability
Implemented the **first shopping functionality** ever integrated into the Meijer Mobile App, establishing the foundation for future e-commerce features.

### Real-Time Coupon Search
Built an intelligent coupon discovery system that searches available coupons in real-time, helping customers clip coupons they might have missed and maximize their savings automatically.

### Ground-Up Swift Development
This was the **first Swift project released from inception** at Meijer, establishing modern iOS development practices and patterns for the organization.

## Impact

- **Millions of downloads** across the Meijer customer base
- **600,000+ monthly active users** at peak usage
- **Improved app rating** from 1.5 to 4.5 stars through continuous quality improvements
- **Enhanced customer satisfaction** with faster, more convenient checkout
- **Competitive advantage** for Meijer in the retail space

## Lessons Learned

### Component Architecture
Building the first independent component framework taught us valuable lessons about modular design, dependency management, and risk mitigation in large codebases. This pattern became the blueprint for future mobile initiatives.

### Swift Migration
As the first ground-up Swift project, we established coding standards, architectural patterns, and best practices that influenced the entire organization's transition from Objective-C to Swift.

### User Feedback
The dramatic rating improvement from 1.5 to 4.5 stars demonstrated the importance of continuously listening to user feedback and iterating rapidly to address concerns.

### Cross-Functional Collaboration
The success of this project reinforced the value of bringing together diverse expertise—product, design, engineering, QA, and leadership—all working toward a common goal.
