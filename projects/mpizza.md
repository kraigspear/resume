# mPizza
## Proving Internal Capability

## Overview

mPizza was a proof-of-concept pizza ordering application developed at Meijer during off-hours. While never officially released, the project successfully demonstrated that internal teams possessed the capability to develop sophisticated mobile ordering solutions independently.

## Background

The project emerged during a turbulent period for traditional retail. Amazon had just acquired Whole Foods and launched Amazon Go stores. Internally, Meijer faced deflating food prices and declining in-store shopping as consumers increasingly dined out.

When rumors surfaced that upper leadership was looking externally to build a pizza ordering app, our team set out to prove we could do it ourselves.

## Development

### Team Initiative

A small group of developers, working outside normal sprint cycles, created a fully functional pizza ordering application. The project included:

- Complete ordering workflow
- Integration with deli operations
- Order printing capability for in-store preparation
- Real-time order management

### My Role

As one of the iOS developers on the initiative, I:
- Built core ordering functionality
- Implemented the user interface
- Collaborated with backend teams on service integration
- Participated in stakeholder demonstrations

## Outcome

When presented to upper management, the working application demonstrated our team's capabilities. Leadership indicated they preferred a broader deli-ordering solution rather than pizza-specific functionality—but the primary goal was achieved: proving that internal teams could build sophisticated mobile solutions without external vendors.

The project involved multiple stakeholders including scrum masters and several levels of management, showcasing cross-functional collaboration.
